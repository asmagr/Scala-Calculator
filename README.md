# Scala-Calculator

We implemented a program/ calculator that is able to : 

  1/ Read Strings representing mathematical functions of a single variable x.
  2/ Convert them to an internal tree-like data representation.
  3/ Compute a value based on different values of x
  4/ Display a set of points (x, f(x)) that will be connected with lines to make the whole picture look like a plot that will represent the mathematical        function.
